# Notable Health Take Home Project
Thanks for taking the time to open this project! You'll find all of the client code for the full application here.

# Installation
Installation is relatively straight forward, just simply run "npm i" to install all of the dependencies.

# Standing Up the Client
To stand up the client simply just run "npm run dev" from there the console will print the local url that the client is being run on.
